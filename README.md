Hello, this is my test task in genesis.
How can you launch my app?
 - Windows
  With help of cmd just enter next commands:
  1. install.bat
  2. start.bat

- Other systems: 
  1. Install windows
  2. Joke

  Of course you can manually install dependencies:
1. In directory /server run 
npm i
npm run start
2. In dir /client
npm i
npm run dev

That's all.
